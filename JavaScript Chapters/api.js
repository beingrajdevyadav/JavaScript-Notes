// ### Note on JavaScript APIs in 2025

// JavaScript APIs continue to evolve rapidly, providing developers with powerful tools to create dynamic and responsive web applications. Here's an overview of notable updates and trends in JavaScript APIs as of 2025:

// #### 1. **Emergence of WebGPU**
//    - **WebGPU** is the successor to WebGL, designed for modern graphics and computation workloads.
//    - It offers better performance and flexibility, enabling developers to leverage advanced GPU capabilities directly from JavaScript.
//    - Applications include gaming, 3D modeling, AI-powered tools, and scientific simulations.

// #### 2. **Enhanced WebAssembly (Wasm) Integration**
//    - JavaScript APIs now provide better support for WebAssembly modules, enabling near-native performance for web applications.
//    - Wasm is increasingly used for complex applications like video editing, machine learning, and large-scale computations in the browser.

// #### 3. **Improved Accessibility APIs**
//    - Enhanced support for the **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)** standard ensures better experiences for users with disabilities.
//    - The introduction of newer APIs, such as **Screen Reader APIs**, allows developers to create applications that provide rich contextual feedback for assistive technologies.

// #### 4. **File System Access API**
//    - The **File System Access API** has become more robust, providing a secure and seamless way to interact with the user's file system.
//    - Developers can now build applications like IDEs, image editors, and media managers with local file access, while ensuring security and privacy.

// #### 5. **WebXR API**
//    - The **WebXR Device API** supports immersive experiences for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).
//    - It includes better integration with hardware devices and improvements in performance, making it a cornerstone for metaverse applications.

// #### 6. **Real-Time Collaboration with WebRTC and WebTransport**
//    - Updates to **WebRTC** enhance real-time audio, video, and data sharing capabilities.
//    - The **WebTransport API** offers improved low-latency communication for real-time multiplayer games and collaborative tools.

// #### 7. **AI and Machine Learning APIs**
//    - JavaScript APIs are increasingly leveraging AI capabilities, such as through **TensorFlow.js** and **ONNX.js**.
//    - Browser-based machine learning models can now process natural language, recognize images, and perform predictive analytics.

// #### 8. **New Features in Fetch and HTTP APIs**
//    - Updates to the **Fetch API** include support for streaming responses and richer error handling.
//    - Enhanced HTTP APIs provide better support for HTTP/3, improving performance and security.

// #### 9. **State Management with App History API**
//    - The **App History API** provides better control over navigation and state management for single-page applications (SPAs), simplifying the developer experience.

// #### 10. **Eco-Friendly and Energy-Aware APIs**
//    - New APIs like the **Battery Status API** and energy-efficient coding practices are encouraged to reduce the environmental impact of web applications.

// #### Conclusion
// JavaScript APIs in 2025 empower developers to build feature-rich, performant, and accessible web applications while leveraging cutting-edge technologies. The focus on performance, accessibility, and integration with emerging technologies positions JavaScript as a key language for modern web development.
